taskly
======

**This project is pre-pre-alpha,** as in the foundation has barely even been
laid yet, that's how new it is.

Taskly is an open-source time tracking and invoice generation app built on
Ember.js, using Ember App Kit as a base, and Laravel 4. Built with <3 for
@swarming and open-sourced to give back to the community and better help me
learn. :)

Roadmap
-------
- Use git-flow
- Write build and contribution instructions
- Start the app
- Figure out why @swarming and the LICENSE README links aren't working
